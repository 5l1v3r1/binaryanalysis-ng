This directory contains a number of test files for testing BANG. For each file type there are a number of variations:

1. test file consists of one target file. For example: one GIF file, or one PNG file

2. test file has data appended to it. For example: a GIF file with extra random bytes added to it

3. test file has data in front. For example: a GIF file with extra random bytes before the start of the GIF.

4. test file has two target files. For example: two GIF files that are concatenated.

5. test file has data missing from the end. For example: GIF file with the last 100 bytes at the end cut off

6. test file has data missing in the middle. For example: GIF file with 100 bytes in the middle cut.

7. test file has data added in the middle. For example: GIF file with data in the middle added.

YAFFS2 images were created using mkyaff2simage, which can be found in git://www.aleph1.co.uk/yaffs2

As yaffs2 can have various sizes for "chunks" and "spares" (for this myaffs2image.c needs to be changed) the following test files were made:

* yaffs2-1024-32-le-empty-file.img : chunk: 1024 bytes, spare: 32 bytes, little endian, single empty file called "test"
* yaffs2-2048-64-le-empty-file.img : chunk: 2048 bytes, spare: 64 bytes, little endian, single empty file called "test"
* yaffs2-4096-128-le-empty-file.img : chunk: 4096 bytes, spare: 128 bytes, little endian, single empty file called "test"
* yaffs2-8192-256-le-empty-file.img : chunk: 8192 bytes, spare: 256 bytes, little endian, single empty file called "test"
